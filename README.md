# Santander-Customer-Transaction
  

This project was part of the Kaggle competition [Santander Customer Transaction Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview)

## Introduction
This data set is provided by Santander in the Kaggle competition 'Santander Customer Transaction Prediction - can you identify who will make a transaction?'. The project's goal is to solve a binary classification. Based on 200 variables found in the data set, we try to identify which customer will make a specific transaction in the future. All variables are anonymized numeric features, with a column for the ID_code and an additional column for the target in the train set.
